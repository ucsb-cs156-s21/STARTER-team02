# LocationForm

An `LocationForm` component can be used to ask for the location value
that we need to pass the the api endpoint
a list of locations.

For purposes of the storybook, a callback function has been provided
that uses `window.alert` to show the values that the callback would
receive.  In a real usage, the form user provides a callback to use
the values in whatever way they are needed (e.g. to fetch data from
an API.)

export const Template = (args) => <LocationForm {...args} />;

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Example" args={{ label: "Example", submitCallback: callback }}>
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
