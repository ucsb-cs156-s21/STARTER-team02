# Loading

The `Loading` component is a spinner that is 
used when we are waiting for data from an API
and it hasn't arrived yet, so we are unable to render the page yet.

If you see a spinner in the window below, that means this component
is working properly!

export const Template = (args) => <Loading {...args} />;

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Example" args={{ label: 'Example' }}>
    {Template.bind({})}
   </Story>
</Canvas>
