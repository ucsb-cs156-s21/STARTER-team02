# CollegeSubredditSelector

A `CollegeSubredditSelector` component is a type-ahead component
that can be used to select from among a list of college CollegeSubredditSelector.
Here is an example with fifteen schools (including all of the UCs, plus
a few extra):
 
export const Template = (args) => <CollegeSubredditSelector {...args} />;

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Fifteen Schools" args={{ label: "Fifteen Schools", subreddits: collegeSubredditFixtures.fifteen }}>
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>


This shows just the UCs:

<Canvas>
  <Story name="All UCs" args={{ label: "All UCs", subreddits: collegeSubredditFixtures.nineUCs }}>
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

And for testing, when there is only one entry (UCSB):

<Canvas>
  <Story name="UCSB Only" args={{ label: "UCSB Only", subreddits: collegeSubredditFixtures.UCSB }}>
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
